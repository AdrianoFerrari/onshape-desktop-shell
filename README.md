“[Onshape](http://example.com/) is the first and only full-cloud 3D CAD system that lets everyone on a design team simultaneously work together using a web browser, phone or tablet. CAD Anywhere, Anytime, On Any Device.”

So, there is no official desktop application since you can use Onshape on a desktop computer using web browser.

But using web browser in this case is not always convenient — you lost all standard ways to open app or to switch to it. 
What if you want to easily switch to Onshape using cmd+tab? And not to lose Onshape among other web pages?

Please note – it is unofficial application.
